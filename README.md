# The Best Classifier
## Machine Learning with Python

For more information, please visit IBM's Data Science Course via Coursera platform.

This is my humble spin on Coursera's Best Classifier project. As such, I have added fivethirtyeight styling to the charts and some additional graphs. For peer review purposes, this is a simple version without hyperparameter optimization and newer accuracy metrics. Open to suggestions for improvement.

Most of the charts have copyright marks, however, please disregard. The copyright marks are only there for design placement purposes. For use, please view the copyright information below.
